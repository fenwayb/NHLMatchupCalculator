# CapData

Communication Protocols:
    We have agreed to meet both during class hours with added time on the front end as well as on Wednesdays on an as-needed basis based on team member availability.

Selected Topic: 
    For our project we are taking a look at NHL performance data and looking to predict user-selected matchups between current NHL teams based on their team stats and game outcomes over the last several years.
    We chose this topic as we all love hockey and in today's game, there is nearly endless data on both sides which can tell a story of how the games will turn out.
    
Data sources: 
    For this project we were able to find a dataset from Kaggle which contains team statistics for NHL teams dating back to the 2013 season. This dataset will give us a solid base of current NHL performance. Roster information is not included. In addition to the team stats, for expected game outcomes, we are using NHL.com's API which gives us a breakdown of every game up until the present day.
    
Question to answer:
    Between two user-selected current NHL teams using nearly a decade of analytics, who will emerge victorious in an "on-paper" matchup without any interference of NHL referees' involvement based on their team statistics?
